== Icons ==

Thanks to Danny Allen and "Exdaix" for the G-Flat SVG icon set.

These icons were obtained from <http://art.gnome.org/themes/icon/1281>.

The license there is stated as CC-BY (Creative Commons Attribution).

One of the icons (gsnes9x-icon.svg) has metadata stating that it is licensed
under the LGPL.  I have created a derivative icon (emulator-game.svg) which
would accordingly also be licensed under the LGPL.

== Code ==

The 'htpicker' file was originally derived from demos/browser.py from pywebkitgtk SVN
r161 on Google Code, which was copyrighted by Jan Michael Alonzo and licensed
under the GPL.  However, at this point, no original code remains other than a
couple trivial lines that would inevitably be written exactly the same way
by any programmer.

I disclaim copyright to the 'htpicker' and 'app.html' files and dedicate them
to the public domain.
